# MSALSwiftUI

This project intends to give an example of how the MSAL iOS library can be used in a SwiftUI App. 
It uses the same MSAL APIs but separated from the View. 
This projects reuses the sample code provided by Microsoft within their MSAL iOS Sample Project:

https://github.com/Azure-Samples/ms-identity-mobile-apple-swift-objc

## Dependencies
* [Resolver](https://github.com/hmlongco/Resolver) for simple dependency injection


## Use your own Azure App

To use this project with your own registered Azure App you need to change the following:
* Project Bundle Identifier
* MSAuthCredentials.swift




## Roadmap

I do not intend to update this project or keep it up to date. 
Microsoft itself is likely to introduce their own Sample Project for SwiftUI soon (state August 2021).
